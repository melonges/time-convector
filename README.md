# ðŸ“… time-convector

The time-convector library provides utility functions for converting time between human-readable format and milliseconds.

## No dependencies

This library does not depend on any other libraries.

## Installation

You can install the time-convector library using npm: `npm install time-convector`

## Usage

```javascript
const { convertToHumanReadable, convertToMs } = require("time-convector");

// Convert milliseconds to human-readable format
convertToHumanReadable(114048000000); // Output: 3Y 8M 23h

// Convert human-readable time to milliseconds
convertToMs("44M"); // Output: 114048000000

// you can combine this functions
convertToHumanReadable(convertToMs("44M")); // Output: 3Y 8M 23h
```

### `convertToHumanReadable(milliseconds)`

This function takes a time duration in milliseconds as input and returns a human-readable format representing years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

### `convertToMs(timeString)`

This function takes a human-readable time duration string as input and returns the equivalent duration in milliseconds.
The string should be in the format of <number><unit>, where the unit can be 'Y' for years, 'M' for months, 'D' for days, 'h' for hours, 'm' for minutes, and 's' for seconds.
